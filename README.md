# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

- React + Vite
- Functional components; state and effect hooks
- BEM methodology + flat file structure
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- JS combined with JSX
- Grid layout
- API weather + time
- (planned) Media queries
